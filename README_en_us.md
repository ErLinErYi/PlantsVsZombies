## Project description <br>
- This game is made by myself. The game is playable (there are 104 levels at present) and will be updated from time to time in the future.
- Compared with the original version, the game has greater resolution, better picture quality and higher refresh rate. The properties in the game are quite different from the original. It's a little harder than the original. There are new game modes, etc.
- Most of the game material comes from the original game material, a small part of the collection from the network, as well as their own production.
- This game is only for learning and communication use, not for commercial purposes, otherwise at your own risk.
- At present, there are 14 kinds of zombies and 13 kinds of plants. The animation of plants and zombies are all done by myself. Due to the limited ability of animation, some zombies and plants can't be realized. (the animation is made by dragonbones / spine).
- If you find any problems with the program or suggestions for the game, you can send them to my QQ: 2117610943 or email: 2117610943@qq.com 。

## Operational requirements
* Install visual studio 2017 or visual studio 2019

***Attention!!! The project cannot be run directly because of the lack of resource files required by the game. (the resource file was removed due to possible infringement. You can ask me for the resource package if you need it especially and only when you are studying. The only requirement: Star the repository and email me a screenshot to prove it. If you don’t want to do that, please exit this repository.)***
